# Employee Feedback Bot & Analysis Platform

This project is a sophisticated system designed to collect, analyze, and manage anonymous employee feedback via a Telegram bot. It was developed as a solution for the Java Junior Developer test task.

The system consists of two main components:
1.  A **Telegram Bot** that serves as the primary interface for employees to register and submit feedback.
2.  A **Spring Boot Web Application** that provides a powerful admin panel to view, filter, and analyze all submitted feedback.

The application leverages the OpenAI API for intelligent text analysis, automatically determining feedback sentiment, criticality, and a suggested solution. It also integrates with Google Docs and Trello for seamless reporting and task management.

## ‚ú® Core Features

-   **ü§ñ Telegram Bot Interaction:**
    -   **Seamless Registration:** On first use, the bot guides the user through a simple registration process to select their position (e.g., Mechanic, Electrician) and branch.
    -   **Effortless Feedback Submission:** Registered users can send any text message to the bot, which is treated as a piece of feedback.

-   **üß† AI-Powered Analysis (via OpenAI):**
    -   **Sentiment Analysis:** Automatically classifies feedback as `POSITIVE`, `NEUTRAL`, or `NEGATIVE`.
    -   **Criticality Assessment:** Assigns a criticality score from 1 (minor) to 5 (urgent).
    -   **Solution Suggestion:** Generates a recommended course of action to address the feedback.

-   **üíæ Database Persistence:**
    -   All user information and feedback records are securely stored in a **PostgreSQL** database.

-   **üîÑ Automated Integrations:**
    -   **Google Docs Logging:** Every piece of feedback is automatically appended to a central Google Document for easy, non-technical access and historical record-keeping.
    -   **Trello Task Creation:** For feedback marked as critical (level 4 or 5), a new card is automatically created on a specified Trello board for immediate action by management.

-   **üíª Web Admin Panel:**
    -   A comprehensive web interface built with Spring Boot & Thymeleaf, accessible at `http://localhost:8080/feedbacks`.
    -   **Advanced Filtering:** Allows administrators to search and filter feedback by branch, position, sentiment, criticality level, and date range.
    -   **Paginated Results:** Efficiently handles large volumes of feedback.
    -   **Detailed View:** A modal window provides a full, detailed view of each feedback item, including the original message and all analysis results.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   **Java JDK 21** or later.
-   **Apache Maven**.
-   **PostgreSQL** database server.
-   An IDE such as **IntelliJ IDEA**.

### 2. Obtain API Keys & Credentials

You will need to obtain credentials for all external services:

-   **Telegram Bot:**
    1.  Talk to `@BotFather` on Telegram.
    2.  Create a new bot to get your **Bot Token** and **Username**.
-   **OpenAI:**
    1.  Sign up on the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
    2.  Go to the API keys section and create a new **API Key**.
-   **Trello:**
    1.  Get your **API Key** at [trello.com/app-key](https://trello.com/app-key).
    2.  Manually generate a **Token** from the same page.
    3.  Create a board and a list for critical feedback. Find the **List ID** by opening a card on that list and adding `.json` to the URL.
-   **Google Docs:**
    1.  Create a project in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    2.  Enable the **Google Docs API**.
    3.  Create a Service Account and download its **credentials JSON file** (e.g., `credentials.json`).
    4.  Create a new Google Doc and get its **Document ID** from the URL.
    5.  Share the Google Doc with the service account's email address, giving it "Editor" permissions.

### 3. Configure the Application

1.  Place your downloaded Google Service Account `credentials.json` file inside the `src/main/resources` directory.
2.  In the `src/main/resources` directory, create a file named `application.properties`.
3.  Fill in the file with your credentials obtained in the previous step, using the template below.

```properties
# ========================================
#  APPLICATION CONFIGURATION
# ========================================

# === DATABASE CONFIGURATION ===
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/feedback_db
spring.datasource.username=postgres
spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect

# === TELEGRAM BOT CONFIGURATION ===
telegram.bot.token=YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN
telegram.bot.username=YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_USERNAME

# === OPENAI CONFIGURATION ===
openai.api.key=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY

# === TRELLO INTEGRATION ===
trello.api.key=YOUR_TRELLO_API_KEY
trello.api.token=YOUR_TRELLO_TOKEN
trello.api.list-id=YOUR_TRELLO_LIST_ID

# === GOOGLE DOCS INTEGRATION ===
google.docs.document-id=YOUR_GOOGLE_DOC_ID
google.docs.credentials-path=credentials.json
```

### 4. Set up the Database

Create a new database in PostgreSQL. For example, using the `psql` command-line tool:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE feedback;
```
Spring Boot with Hibernate (`ddl-auto: update`) will automatically create the necessary tables on the first run.

### 5. Run the Application

You can run the application in several ways:

**A) From your IDE (Recommended):**
1.  Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2.  Wait for Maven to download all dependencies.
3.  Find the main application class (the one with the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation).
4.  Right-click and select "Run".

**B) Using Maven from the command line:**
Navigate to the project's root directory and run:
```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will start, and the Telegram bot will begin polling for updates.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Telegram Bot

1.  Find your bot on Telegram using its username.
2.  Send the `/start` command.
3.  The bot will prompt you to select your position from a custom keyboard.
4.  Next, it will ask for your branch name.
5.  Once registered, any text message you send will be processed as feedback. You will receive a confirmation after your feedback is analyzed.

### Web Admin Panel

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/feedbacks`.
2.  You will see a paginated list of all feedback received.
3.  Use the filter form at the top to narrow down results by branch, position, sentiment, criticality, or date.
4.  Click the "–î–µ—Ç–∞–ª—ñ" button on any row to open a modal with the full, detailed information about that feedback, including the original message and AI-generated solution.
